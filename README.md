# Bill Splitter: A Vue.js Project
By: Nolan Schoenle
Current Version: 0.1

## Purpose:
This application aims to relieve the headache of figuring out who owes whom how much when going somewhere but 
only getting one bill. By establishing the paying parties and assigning the reciept items, this app calculates
the amount each party needs to pay.

## Setup: V.01 will need to either be run on a Dev server or built by the user

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# install the Vuex dependency 
npm install vuex

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Known Issues:
* No support for editing/removing party members
* No support for editing/removing bill items
* No persistence after app reload
* UI needs tweaking
* Does not meet accessibility requirements
